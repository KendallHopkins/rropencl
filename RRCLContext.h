/*!
 * The RROpenCL framework does not overlay an additional layer of abstraction on
 * top of OpenCL, but merely to objectify the existing layer in Objective-C
 * terms.
 *
 * The difference is only one of styling and memory management. Both are
 * practical goals. Styling: because the natural interface to OpenCL is C-based,
 * and hence arguments do not naturally accept Foundation types such as
 * NSString, NSArray, etc. Memory management: because C-based objects live
 * outside the more natural memory management models built into Objective-C,
 * whether it be retain-release or garbage collected model.
 *
 * Wrapping OpenCL objects in Objective-C NSObject-derived classes makes them
 * accessible to and subject to advanced memory management. In parallel
 * environments, e.g. using blocks and Grand Central dispatch, putting objects
 * in view of the garbage collector can remove many implementation
 * headaches. Hence, the advantage of wrapping.
